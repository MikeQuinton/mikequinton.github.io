Here I am, back on the blog after my initial post from March earlier this year. Life has taken a turn since then—I’ve found a new role for myself in southern Germany, moving here from the UK. Adjusting to life here has been an interesting learning curve, to say the least. That being said, I’ve decided to get back on track after a brief hiatus and will be posting again from here.

Lately, I’ve been dedicating a lot of time to brushing up on my Linux skills, covering everything from the basics to more in-depth topics.
