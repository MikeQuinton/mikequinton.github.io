For a while now I've been sitting on the idea of starting a blog to go over anything I learn, want to share, fail on and most imporantly to showcase my projects to the wider audience.

The blog itself will be dedicated mostly to the technical troubles in the world but you may see the occasional sprinkle of other hobbies dotted around. Brazilian Jiu jitsu being one of them.

Overall, I plan to treat this as place to talk about my journey from an Infrastructure Engineer through to understanding and stepping into the DevOps world.

My steps into the pain and experience of starting a blog and bring it to life:

- Go through various blogs and articles talking about static site generators
- Tried Pelican but decided on Hugo, overall just seemed nicer to work with
- Used various themes but settled on anatole
- Ran a local hugo server and customise the configs for myself
- Done various commits to repository whilst trying to figure out what I am doing
- Configure github actions to deploy the hugo blog
- Loaded "mikequinton.github.io", enjoyed the work and relaxed
