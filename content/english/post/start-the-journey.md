For a while now, I've been contemplating the idea of starting a blog to document anything I learn, want to share, fail at, and most importantly, to showcase my projects to a wider audience.

The blog itself will be primarily dedicated to technical topics, although you may occasionally find mentions of other hobbies, such as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

Overall, I plan to treat this as a place to discuss my journey from being an Infrastructure Engineer to understanding and stepping into the DevOps world.

Here are the steps I've taken in the challenging yet rewarding process of starting and bringing a blog to life:

- I explored various blogs and articles discussing static site generators.
- Tried Pelican but ultimately decided on Hugo; it just seemed more user-friendly.
- Experimented with various themes but settled on Anatole.
- Ran a local Hugo server and customized the configs to suit my needs.
- Made various commits to the repository while trying to figure out what I'm doing.
- Configured GitHub Actions to deploy the Hugo blog.
- Finally, I loaded "mikequinton.github.io," enjoyed the work, and relaxed.
