Hey there! My name is Michael Quinton.

I'm an Infrastructure Engineer from the UK, living here in Germany. By day, I troubleshoot technical issues, implement new solutions, and in my free time, I'm all about crafting scalable, secure, and automated cloud solutions. Right now, I'm diving into Terraform, Python and AWS, along with whatever else grabs my interest in the tech world. I've been in the tech profession for about 10+ years now and look forward to continuing it.

👨🏼‍💻 **What I'm learning:**
- Kubernetes
- Terraform
- Python
- AWS
- CI/CD
- Whatever else catches my eye!

🌈 **For fun:**
- Challenging myself in Jiu-Jitsu, and occasionally nursing my injuries
- Trying not to faceplant while learning to snowboard
- Enjoying some not-so-healthy snacks
- Hanging out with my cat, Eevee!
- Taking in the breathtaking views of Iceland or Austria when I can
- Embracing whatever life throws my way
- Squeezing in some video game time when I can

**If you're:**
- Looking for someone to geek out with about tech
- Wanting to collaborate or chat about my profile
- Curious about my tech journey or life experiences
